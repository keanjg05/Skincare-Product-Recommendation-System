# Skincare-Product-Recommendation-System
A machine learning-based system that helps users find the right skincare products for their skin type and concerns. Users describe their skin issues in natural language (like “dry skin with redness and acne”), and the system suggests compatible products, explaining which ingredients and benefits make them suitable. Built using a neural network trained from scratch to match products to user needs.
