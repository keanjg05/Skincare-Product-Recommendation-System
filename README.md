# Skincare-Product-Recommendation-System
A machine learning-based system that helps users find the right skincare products for their skin type and concerns. Users describe their skin issues in natural language (like “dry skin with redness and acne”), and the system suggests compatible products, explaining which ingredients and benefits make them suitable. Built using a neural network trained from scratch to match products to user needs.

**Training Data**

The full training files used for this project are available on Zenodo due to size limits on GitHub:

🔗 https://zenodo.org/records/17887635

These files are optional for running the notebook. You do NOT need to download them to successfully run the project.

All that is required is the cosmetic_p.csv file placed in your working directory. When you run the notebook consecutively, all additional training files and processed datasets are automatically generated during execution.

**Evaluation**

For evaluation, the files located in data/model can be used immediately. These can be uploaded directly through the notebook’s upload interface to run the evaluation notebook without re-training the models.
